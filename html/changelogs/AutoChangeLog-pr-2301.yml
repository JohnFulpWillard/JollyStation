changes:
  - balance: Anyone with wings or a wagging lizard tail will have a small bonus to
      their tacklling offense/defense.
  - balance: Moths and lizards that lose their wings/tail will have worse tackling
      values instead.
  - balance: Fly people don't take splatting themselves on windows/walls easily and
      have a higher chance to get a bad result from that.
